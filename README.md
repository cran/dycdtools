# dycdtools package

An R package for assisting calibration and visualising outputs of DYRESM-CAEDYM.

* The calibration assistant function ("calib.assist") tries a large number of possible combinations of parameter values that users regard as potentially suitable for their model calibration, and calculates the values of nominated objective functions for each combination. 

* Four post-processing functions are included to visualise simulation results:

  * Scatter plot
  * Contour plot
  * Time series plot
  * Profile plot
